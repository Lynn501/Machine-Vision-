The Machine Vision coursework for me. (2023)
The GoogleNet, LeNet, ResNet are the pre-train model which use my dataset, and the output has been recorded in my report.
The train_v0 is the code for tankCarCls_v0 which is CBAM attention.
The train_v1 is the code for tankCarCls_v1 which is layer attention added to the CBAM attention.
All their output has been recorded in my report.
